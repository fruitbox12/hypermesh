`# Hypercore Operator

The Hypercore Operator is a Kubernetes Operator that manages Hypercore servers in your OpenShift cluster. It leverages the Operator SDK and Kubernetes APIs to create, update, and delete Hypercore servers as needed.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Hypercore Operator, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

- Go (1.13+)
- Node.js (14.x or later)
- NPM (6.x or later)
- Docker (19.x or later)
- Operator SDK (1.10+)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:`

git clone <https://github.com/yourusername/hypercore-operator.git> cd hypercore-operator


 `2. Generate the Operator code and file structure using the provided shell script:`

./generate_hypercore_operator.sh


 `### Usage

1. Modify the `api/v1/hypercoreserver_types.go` file to define the desired spec and status fields for the HypercoreServer custom resource.

2. Implement the reconciliation logic in the `controllers/hypercoreserver_controller.go` file. This logic will be executed when a new HypercoreServer resource is created, updated, or deleted.

3. Update the Dockerfile to include your Node.js application for the webhook server.

4. Build the Operator image and push it to your preferred container registry:`

docker build -t your-operator-image:latest . docker push your-operator-image:latest


 `5. Deploy the Operator to your OpenShift cluster:`

kubectl apply -f deploy/crds/example.com_hypercoreservers_crd.yaml kubectl apply -f deploy/service_account.yaml kubectl apply -f deploy/role.yaml kubectl apply -f deploy/role_binding.yaml kubectl apply -f deploy/operator.yaml


 `6. Once the Operator is running, you can create HypercoreServer resources to manage Hypercore servers in your cluster:`

kubectl apply -f deploy/crds/example.com_v1_hypercoreserver_cr.yaml


 `### Webhook Server

The Hypercore Operator includes a webhook server that listens on port 3000. The webhook server is responsible for handling Hypercore actions such as announce, unannounce, and lookup. It exposes a REST API that can be accessed externally.

To modify the webhook server behavior, update the `webhook/server.js` file.
